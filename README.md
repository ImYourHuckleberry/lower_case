See this is a 32 key buckling spring keyboard inspired by the IBM Model F.
In order to have actually wanted to arrive on this page you need to be:
1) Interested in mechanichal keyboards
2) Interested in vintage keyboards
3) Interested in tiny keyboards
4) Absurdly tiny keyboards
5) Willing to order a spec pcb by someone with no education or right making such a thing
6) Able to get your hands on the necessarry flippers, springs, controllers, barrels, and drivers needed to actually make any of this work
7) Pretty cool

# WARNING

You better use a solenoid in this, if you don't I'll know and I'll find you and take your board away and start discord trask talk. If I ever find out someone tries to make this linear I am taking my proverbial ball offline and going home.

# Some notes

PCB, 3MF, and STEP files for the lower case capacative keyboard

right now I dont even know if this will work!

If you are just looking to make the pcb you need these. The ground plate is necessarry, dont skip it. I went with 0.8 for thickness

lowercase/gerber_pcb.zip
lowercase/gnd_gerber.zip

3D parts should be in there. I have printed them and they look good and fit well. I am using threaded insert embedded nuts to screw on the mounting bracket. 
Basically a little threaded pipe you heat up with a soldering iron and it embeds into the print. This way you have something to actually screw into.

Basically you need the case cause of course you do. The plate is curved so IDK how else you could get one. The mounting bracket snugs the whole thing up.

# How do all the components fit
# Good question!!
